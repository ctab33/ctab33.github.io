I've always been a learner and I can't stop. It's almost like an addiction. I've studied chemistry, journalism, education, and even religion. And since 2014, I've been attempting to learn how to code. 

I went into teaching straight out of college. It was a great experience (I went for the master’s in education while fulfilling my certification requirements), but I knew didn’t want to go into school administration, so I left after a little over a decade of service. From this experience, I garnered the ability to teach learners at various levels who may have different styles. As an added bonus, I overcame the fear of public speaking, since I had to speak in front of 5 to 6 classes of about 30 students per class, five days a week. 

I finished out the school year in 2012 and began graduate school in the fall, where I ended up earning an MA in Journalism. That’s where I was introduced into the magic of coding.  Even as a student, the prospect of finding a job in the field was bleak, unless you knew how to code.  The thing is, I'm a creative. While yes, technically I've been a journalist, my brain thinks in both artistic and logical terms. I've always had the former, and I chalk up the latter to my undergraduate chemistry degree. I have to solve problems, but I have to solve them in new, innovative and creative ways. 

That's probably why I ended up doing HTML and CSS templates at a media company shortly after graduation. The company’s intent was to tell stories in engaging ways that would draw the user in. It was a great mix for me: I had the opportunity to code as a product developer and hone my skills as a digital producer. It also challenged me to learn more about coding. Still, I felt and still feel, like I can learn more. While I love the resources I've used so far to learn coding, I want to go deeper. I feel like I'm just barely at the surface, and honestly, I need structure and help to maximize my potential. Hence my application to Flatiron.  The knowledge I did have of tech and coding allowed me to get hired by a startup as a Product and Content Manager, where I was the go-to person between the CEO and the engineers building the web app. I could speak both languages, if you will. But, as is prone to happen with some startups, this one did not survive, and I found myself unemployed in July of 2016. I've since decided to get serious about learning software development. I want to know how to build things from scratch. I want to be able to take a vision or a concept and make it come alive. 

So if you’d ask me what makes me unique, I’d answer what my graduate advisor told me: I’m a unicorn. When she first told me that I gave her a quizzical look. She laughed and said, “You’ve got 3 things most people would love to have: you can teach, you can tell stories, and you know about code.” 

This next step at The Flatiron School is the logical next step for me. I want to learn in a flexible yet structured environment. And I want to fall keep falling in love with software development. 

I think I’m on my way.
