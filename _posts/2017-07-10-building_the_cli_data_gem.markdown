Building the CLI Data Gem was both a gut wrenching and exhilarating experience--a challenge to say the least. I went through something akin to the 5 stages of grief. New developer grief, that is--but the same stages nonetheless. For days I was in denial, thinking I could get this done on my predetermined time frame. 

Only I couldn’t. I had developer writer’s block. I fretted over planning and execution of the code. At night, I’d dream (and sometimes have nightmares) about how to code this thing. I stressed myself out to the point of analysis paralysis. So I took a break. 

While I continued to do and read other OO and Ruby related things, I didn’t look at the project for a week. I thought about it here and there, but I just had to put it to rest for a bit. 

When I finally decided I couldn’t put it off any longer, I procrastinated some more. Then I coded a scraper that didn’t work. Disheartened, I put it down for two more days. I came back to it and decided to just do what I did when I started front-end development: I started experimenting. 

I have to pause here to insert a caveat. I’m a perfectionist. It’s hard for me to not get things right the first time. That coupled with my self-imposed deadline only created unnecessary anxiety. That’s why I let it go for a bit. 

After I regrouped, I went back to pore over the gems listed in the project instructions. I started breaking things in the code, which initially seemed sacrilegious to do that to someone else’s code. I actually learned new ways to write Ruby code from them, like how to use xpath in lieu of css when searching through an HTML document, and the use of the magical ||= assignment operator. Once I really understood what *that* did, well...mind blown.  

And then, I started to code. I wrote out my pseudo code on a sheet of paper and then I wrote the scraper again. Most importantly, by this time, I gave myself permission to fail miserably. At least I would know what didn’t work. Trial and error became a process I embraced instead of avoided.  

I learn better when I have to actually do something from scratch and building the CLI project allowed me to build upon the coding muscles. For my project, I ended up scraping the Vox explainer news site.

I was in a hackathon recently with a fellow Learn student where we were mutually sharing our coding struggles. “It only gets harder,” he said. That’s okay though. I think I’ve found a process that works for me to get me through those harder projects.
